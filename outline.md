# Paper Outline

## Introduction

### Algorithms

Give a table of the algorithms

Speak about each of the algorithms here. Talk about results from previous paper. Talk about strengths and weaknesses.

### Datasets

Present table of datasets

Speak in-depth about each of them.

## Speed vs Input length

Talk about the lengths of packets. How performance could be affected. Present graphs. Speak about results. Talk about implications if flooded with long packets.

## Speed vs Number of Matches

Talk about the possibility of a brown-out if too many matches are found. present graphs.

## Speed vs Number of Threads

Talk about parallelism. Present graphs. Talk about findings. Where lines intersect etc.
